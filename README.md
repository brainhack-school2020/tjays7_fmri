# Predictive Model using fMRI 

Team contributors: Tajwar Sultana

## Summary 

Interested in designing a predictive model using fMRI. The prediction variable could be age and/or gender and/or diagnosis (depends on the dataset).

## Project definition 

### Background

I am a Computer Engineering PhD student and my topic of research is Effective Brain Connectivity using fMRI. Being Computer Engineer, I already had the exposure of python and machine learning and very little github. Now it would be great to exercise the machine learning principles on neuroimaging data. 

### Tools 

 - Python visualization and machine learning packages (nilearn, scikit-learn, matlplotlib...)
 - Github for version control 
 - NO virtualization (I so wanted to explore virtualization but docker is not compatible with my WSL)

### Data 

Still searching... 

### Deliverables

 - Jupyter notebook with predictive model 
 - Presentation slides
 - This document/report that you are reading marked as "Completed"  

## Results 

### Progress overview

 

### Tools I learned during this project

 * I think I would be able to used github efficiently at the end of this project
 * Machine learning packages for neuroimaging
